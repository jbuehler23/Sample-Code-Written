Assignment 7

1) Read the file (News.txt) in
  A. While News.txt has another line
    i. Dump the file into a string builder
2) Read the dictionary file in
  A. While Unabr2u.txt has another line
    i. Dump the file into a string builder
    ii. Send all letters to lowercase
3) While News.txt has another letter
  A. If the next letters are '<ID>'
    i. If the next letter is an integer
	- Put the next integers into the ListMap
  B. If the next letters are '<BODY>'
    i. foreach char in '<BODY>'
   	- if the char is punctuation
          1. Append to the string builder all that isn't punctuation
    i. If the next word is in Unabr2u.txt
        - Put that word to the ListMap
    ii. Else do nothing
4) Create an Iterator for the ListMap
5) Create an integer freq variable
6) While Iterator of original ListMap has next
  A. Create a temp ListMap
  B. While iterator of original ListMap has next
  C. Get next word
  D. If the ListMap contains that word
    i. Put that word into temp ListMap
    ii. For each time the temp ListMap contains that word
      1. freq++
      2. clear temp ListMap
7) Create a temp ListMap
9) While Iterator of Original ListMap has next
  A. Get next word or integer
  B. If the ListMap contains that word or integer
    i. Put into temp once
  C. Print temp + freq
