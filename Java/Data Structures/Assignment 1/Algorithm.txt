Algorithm:

1) Read in line by line the html file (for loop)
2) If <"words to space" is present 
        -push the word into stack
      If </"words> is not present
        -pop off stack and print error message         
3) If <!"text"
        -do nothing
4) If <"words" />
        -do nothing
5) If nothing is popped off stack print a "completed successfully" message
