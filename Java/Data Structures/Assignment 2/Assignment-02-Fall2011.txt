Assignment 2

Stacks

Part 1.
The Java Stack class allows us to put single items onto the stack.  Sometimes it is more convenient 
to group items together and put them on the stack.  This can be done by creating a simple class 
and then putting instances of this class onto the stack.  In this exercide we will want to put
pairs of items onto the stack.  So you are going to create a class called PairType.  The class will 
be used as a container for a pair of items of any type.  That is, the class will look like:

public class PairType<E1, E2>
{
    //your instance variables and methods
}

The first item in the pair will be of type E1, the second item will beof type E2.
Your class should have get and set methods for the two items.

Part 2.
In the first assignment you found tags and checked to see if the tags were properly matched.  When 
you found a tag you plaed it on the stack.  In this assignment I want you to save the tag and its 
line number on the stack.  With this information you can give the user more information if an
error is detected.  That is, if you find an unmatched open tag you can tell the user the location
in the document where the error has occurred.

Use the file Alice.html to test your application.
