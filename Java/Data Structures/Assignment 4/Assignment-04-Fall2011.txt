Assignment 4

Sets and Maps

The file "Reuters00.txt" is the same file you used in the previous assignment.

 We want to determine the articles in which particular word appears.  Therefore, we want to
 create a map with an entry for each word and a set containing the id numbers of the documents
 that contain that word. The words should not be case sensititive.  Your program should not 
 place numerical strings into the map. Punctuation and special characters should be removed.
 
 After all articles have been read and processed your program should write the contents of the 
 map to an output file.
